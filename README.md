# RBG-Switcher
Choose your RGB code!

The BACKGROUND:

Just hit the switch button and the rgb combination of your chosen color can be used in your projects.

This project was made with the idea of helping users to select their chosen color, similar to colour-wheel, only much simpler to use. 

I used Vanilla JS, along with the usual HTML/CSS. 

PROBLEMS?
I came across no problems. Everything was straight forward when implementing this project on the JS side, as well as on the HTML and styling side. It's a simple app with simple functionality. 

REDEFINITION?
I could implement this project in a different way, such that instead of RGB codes being generated, Hex codes could be the alternative as many users would want that. This would just require an injection of the hex codes instead of the RGB combination. So it's a simple change for the alternative.
